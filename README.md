# First-Challenge-Week1

First I created a repository on github, then I brought it to my local machine, on my local machine I created a Dev branch and within that branch were created 5 more feature/Q-N, Once created, I made a pull request on GitHub.

My resolution of feature/Q-01 -> I created a logic class, then put the impression with user, the input of students, condition from 1 to 100 students. I used the matrix method to store the names of the students and number of problems. I made a loop of repetition that stored the notes and problems, then checked if the amount of characters of the student did not overcome 20 characters, also checked if it did not exceed 10 problems, then condition that saved the largest amount of problems and another condition that came back who had in the matrix the least amount of problems, and if it had equal, returned the reverse of the alphabetical order.

My resolution of feature/Q-02 -> I created a logical class and called in the main, were created two strings of fun and sad, where was introduced the command of data entry, type string and used with command 'indexof' to find the position of the emotion in the string, then with that, was created a loop of repetition that returned the number for the chosen emotion, then fall into the conditions and print the result.

My resolution of feature/Q-03 -> I did all the logic in the main, where it has the string entry, the list was created and saved the string in the list, then used command stream()" to create a stream of elements. It uses the "reduce()" method to sum the values from the list. Then an array was generated where the split command was used into substrings whenever it encounters the + and are stored in the array, so conditions were generated to identify the operator and finally returned the values calculated on the screen.

My resolution of feature/Q-04 -> My resolution was to create the first address table, where the names and attributes of each item were defined, and the person table was created where it was also created their names and assignments, but with binding in the address id.

My resolution of feature/Q-05 -> My resolution was to use the mongodb compass, where I created a database and generated a table with the information with the only difference in the address, which was used as an object and were made 6 sub objects, then was saved in Json format

Github -> All questions were asked in their own branches and 2-3 commits were made, After all ready, a pull request was made in the main.
